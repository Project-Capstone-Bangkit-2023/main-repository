## Background Facts

Indonesia is famous for its natural beauty, beautiful beaches, national parks, traditional villages, and hidden gems that highlight its rich culture and heritage. The tourism sector is vital for the country's development as it creates jobs, increases national income, and improves infrastructure. The growth of tourism is expected to improve the quality of life for local communities while preserving the environment and cultural heritage. Therefore, we have developed an application to help tourists explore Indonesia, while also supporting infrastructure development and enhancing connectivity to tourist destinations.
